2025-07-20: An easier way
========================

# An easier way!
I can't believe how stupidly I was using this thing. The previous workflow was:

1. Write the post in LibreOffice
2. Paste it into the Neocities HTML editor (the web-based one)
3. Manually format it

No wonder I was never consistent making these things! It took about 2 hours to format the fucking blog post let alone actually writing it. So I've got a new solution. I wrote a little bash script (you can find it at [/assets/scripts/md2html.sh](file:///home/alekks/repositories/shironeko.dev/assets/scripts/md2html.sh)) that converts the Markdown files from my text editor to HTML, with all the formatting that I want. Seems to work ok... On that topic, today and yesterday was the first time I properly modded and put content on my site. It was pretty barren. Now that it's summer (end of it but summer nonetheless) I'll have more time to put my shit on here, and mayhaps it'll be of some use to you. I also got my onion mirror back up working. :>

## So what do I have to say today? 
Oh boy (or girl, or other) do I have a lot to tell you. I finally locked in and toughened up my OPSEC for all my personal computer/phone usage this week. It's probably still shit but it's better than it was before. 

### I2P
I've been aware of and using I2P for a few years, but as you can tell I'm just a dumb user and I had a really nasty ass getup for whenever I wanted/needed to use the thing:
1. Paste the new network and proxy settings into my regular web browser
2. Manually SSH into my I2P router
3. Manually change the network settings back after done using it

So obviously this works, and I didn't use I2P all that much then, so it was fine. Well, *"fine."* Then as I was doing this ritual for the umpteenth time I had the brilliant idea of using another web browser to access I2P and just leave my other one alone for clearnet traffic. *Whaaatttt!??!??*

So I installed GNU IceCat., it came with a bunch of bullshit like "LibreJS" which blocks any javascript that's not free software. I love free software too but holy shit go outside. You can't remove all those addons either, you're stuck with them. But I digress, now I've got it set up for my I2P traffic, and I've firejailed it because I'm a paranoid schizoid. 

### Social Media
I never really used social media much, but I made accounts on there because I thought that since I was using a separate email and all that shit they couldn't profile me (this was like 5 years ago, don't judge). Obviously once you make them you can't exactly go back, or at least that's the popular perception it seems among people of my particular age cohort. If you're in high school in the United States and don't have an Instagram or Snapchat account you're living in the dark ages basically.

A few days ago, though, I woke up in the middle of the night and realized that I had not logged into these accounts in over 6 months and would likely never feel the need to use them, and that I might as well just delete it so they delete some of my data as required by law. Of course, a lot of it will stay in their hands forever, but I can't really do anything to change that. So now my only social media is Bluesky, since I have a very modest level of trust in their service.

But let's not make it all about me. I got a few brilliant takes on this shit service category, so keep reading. Prepare to have your preexisting opinions validated!!!

#### The umpteenth short-form-content and generative AI rant

As previously stated I'm in the current-high school aged cohort of American teens, and I'm on the frontlines of this generation's battle with social media addiction, particularly to a category of social media which is generally referred to as "short-form content" and "generative AI" and by me as the brain pancake machine. I don't know if this is just me living under a rock or taking it too seriously but I've observed a marked decline in the average level of intelligence and the capability of these people to make their own fucking opinions. I'm gonna illustrate an example for you here:

Last year I took the class "AP Computer Science Principles", a pretty basic introduction into computer science and some internet protocols, using Javascript as the language of instruction. It was a pretty fun class, and my teacher was cool (was gone for most of the year though) but I sat to some real retards and they showed me the pits of humanity's worst.

I would like to preface this by saying that they were chill people, I enjoyed talking to them. I am also not shaming them, I'm pretty stupid myself, and I can't code to save my life. Just the degree of their brainrot was contagious though, I swear I lost a few braincells sitting next to them. The general routine for them that I observed in that class was.
1. Show up to class late, argue with the teacher.
2. Scroll TikTok/reels during instruction.
3. When time comes to actually do work, ask me to do it for them
4. When I say no, ask ChatGPT/Grok/whatever the fuck weird ass names these megacorps come up with

We're so fucking doomed chat

### Recent political developments
This month we saw a ton of shit go down with the Trump presidency. First that "Big Beautiful Bill" getting passed [because Lisa Murkowski got some Trumpist dick](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/01/congress/lisa-murkowski-repulican-megabill-alaska-00435150), to now the whole Epstein scandal being reignited and carried against the guy who started it. I'm honestly amazed nobody's seceded yet. But I'm along for the ride since I'm not 18 yet and I can't vote. But that's that.
