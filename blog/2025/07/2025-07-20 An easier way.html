<h1 id="an-easier-way-1">An easier way!</h1>
<p>I can’t believe how stupidly I was using this thing. The previous
workflow was:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write the post in LibreOffice</li>
<li>Paste it into the Neocities HTML editor (the web-based one)</li>
<li>Manually format it</li>
</ol>
<p>No wonder I was never consistent making these things! It took about 2
hours to format the fucking blog post let alone actually writing it. So
I’ve got a new solution. I wrote a little bash script (you can find it
at <a
href="file:///home/alekks/repositories/shironeko.dev/assets/scripts/md2html.sh">/assets/scripts/md2html.sh</a>)
that converts the Markdown files from my text editor to HTML, with all
the formatting that I want. Seems to work ok… On that topic, today and
yesterday was the first time I properly modded and put content on my
site. It was pretty barren. Now that it’s summer (end of it but summer
nonetheless) I’ll have more time to put my shit on here, and mayhaps
it’ll be of some use to you. I also got my onion mirror back up working.
:&gt;</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-i-have-to-say-today">So what do I have to say
today?</h2>
<p>Oh boy (or girl, or other) do I have a lot to tell you. I finally
locked in and toughened up my OPSEC for all my personal computer/phone
usage this week. It’s probably still shit but it’s better than it was
before.</p>
<h3 id="i2p">I2P</h3>
<p>I’ve been aware of and using I2P for a few years, but as you can tell
I’m just a dumb user and I had a really nasty ass getup for whenever I
wanted/needed to use the thing: 1. Paste the new network and proxy
settings into my regular web browser 2. Manually SSH into my I2P router
3. Manually change the network settings back after done using it</p>
<p>So obviously this works, and I didn’t use I2P all that much then, so
it was fine. Well, <em>“fine.”</em> Then as I was doing this ritual for
the umpteenth time I had the brilliant idea of using another web browser
to access I2P and just leave my other one alone for clearnet traffic.
<em>Whaaatttt!??!??</em></p>
<p>So I installed GNU IceCat., it came with a bunch of bullshit like
“LibreJS” which blocks any javascript that’s not free software. I love
free software too but holy shit go outside. You can’t remove all those
addons either, you’re stuck with them. But I digress, now I’ve got it
set up for my I2P traffic, and I’ve firejailed it because I’m a paranoid
schizoid.</p>
<h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>
<p>I never really used social media much, but I made accounts on there
because I thought that since I was using a separate email and all that
shit they couldn’t profile me (this was like 5 years ago, don’t judge).
Obviously once you make them you can’t exactly go back, or at least
that’s the popular perception it seems among people of my particular age
cohort. If you’re in high school in the United States and don’t have an
Instagram or Snapchat account you’re living in the dark ages
basically.</p>
<p>A few days ago, though, I woke up in the middle of the night and
realized that I had not logged into these accounts in over 6 months and
would likely never feel the need to use them, and that I might as well
just delete it so they delete some of my data as required by law. Of
course, a lot of it will stay in their hands forever, but I can’t really
do anything to change that. So now my only social media is Bluesky,
since I have a very modest level of trust in their service.</p>
<p>But let’s not make it all about me. I got a few brilliant takes on
this shit service category, so keep reading. Prepare to have your
preexisting opinions validated!!!</p>
<h4 id="the-umpteenth-short-form-content-and-generative-ai-rant">The
umpteenth short-form-content and generative AI rant</h4>
<p>As previously stated I’m in the current-high school aged cohort of
American teens, and I’m on the frontlines of this generation’s battle
with social media addiction, particularly to a category of social media
which is generally referred to as “short-form content” and “generative
AI” and by me as the brain pancake machine. I don’t know if this is just
me living under a rock or taking it too seriously but I’ve observed a
marked decline in the average level of intelligence and the capability
of these people to make their own fucking opinions. I’m gonna illustrate
an example for you here:</p>
<p>Last year I took the class “AP Computer Science Principles”, a pretty
basic introduction into computer science and some internet protocols,
using Javascript as the language of instruction. It was a pretty fun
class, and my teacher was cool (was gone for most of the year though)
but I sat to some real retards and they showed me the pits of humanity’s
worst.</p>
<p>I would like to preface this by saying that they were chill people, I
enjoyed talking to them. I am also not shaming them, I’m pretty stupid
myself, and I can’t code to save my life. Just the degree of their
brainrot was contagious though, I swear I lost a few braincells sitting
next to them. The general routine for them that I observed in that class
was. 1. Show up to class late, argue with the teacher. 2. Scroll
TikTok/reels during instruction. 3. When time comes to actually do work,
ask me to do it for them 4. When I say no, ask ChatGPT/Grok/whatever the
fuck weird ass names these megacorps come up with</p>
<p>We’re so fucking doomed chat</p>
<h3 id="recent-political-developments">Recent political
developments</h3>
<p>This month we saw a ton of shit go down with the Trump presidency.
First that “Big Beautiful Bill” getting passed <a
href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/07/01/congress/lisa-murkowski-repulican-megabill-alaska-00435150">because
Lisa Murkowski got some Trumpist dick</a>, to now the whole Epstein
scandal being reignited and carried against the guy who started it. I’m
honestly amazed nobody’s seceded yet. But I’m along for the ride since
I’m not 18 yet and I can’t vote. But that’s that.</p>
