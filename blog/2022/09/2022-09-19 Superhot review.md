2022-09-19: Superhot review
========================
Recently I played SUPERHOT, a highly innovative shooter that I’m disappointed I didn’t find earlier. I just completed the standard game – here are my thoughts.

I found that the game was a decent challenge – a welcome sight thanks to me getting decent at HOI4 and other games. I hadn’t really ever played shooters before – I think I may check out some more.

The main gimmick of the game is that time only moves when you do, ie. when you’re walking, or turning your body. This would make it way too easy had it not been for the fact that the AI would be impossible to beat without this gimmick. Another key tenet is that weapons can be stolen after an enemy is stunned – they drop their weapon, which you can then use to kill other enemies. I found this to be very useful.

The player is put at an extreme disadvantage in each level – you start out without a gun, and even when you do find one your reload time is much longer than than of the AI. Coupled with you being surrounded and outnumbered, it is quite difficult indeed.

Though a minor part of the whole experience, the game does have a story. I won’t spoil anything, but it is pretty interesting and adds a flair of suspense and mystery to the game. I think it’s made better by the mysterious enemies you’re fighting and the hospital-esque visuals. You fight Red Guys while trapped in strange grey rooms – it’s a bit strange, really.

After you complete the base game, you gain access to certain features unavailable otherwise – new gamemodes being among them. I’ll definitely give these a try.

A key point in why I enjoyed this game is thanks to its running well on my laptop. Though my laptop is decently specced, it still struggles to reach 60 fps on multiple games in my inventory. With SUPERHOT, I had no such issues. It always ran at a clean 60 fps, without any major drops. It was quite enjoyable.

Overall, I would highly recommend it to any gamer – casual or hardcore. It gets a 10/10 from me.
