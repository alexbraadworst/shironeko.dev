<h1 id="superhot-review">2022-09-19: Superhot review</h1>
<p>Recently I played SUPERHOT, a highly innovative shooter that I’m
disappointed I didn’t find earlier. I just completed the standard game –
here are my thoughts.</p>
<p>I found that the game was a decent challenge – a welcome sight thanks
to me getting decent at HOI4 and other games. I hadn’t really ever
played shooters before – I think I may check out some more.</p>
<p>The main gimmick of the game is that time only moves when you do, ie.
when you’re walking, or turning your body. This would make it way too
easy had it not been for the fact that the AI would be impossible to
beat without this gimmick. Another key tenet is that weapons can be
stolen after an enemy is stunned – they drop their weapon, which you can
then use to kill other enemies. I found this to be very useful.</p>
<p>The player is put at an extreme disadvantage in each level – you
start out without a gun, and even when you do find one your reload time
is much longer than than of the AI. Coupled with you being surrounded
and outnumbered, it is quite difficult indeed.</p>
<p>Though a minor part of the whole experience, the game does have a
story. I won’t spoil anything, but it is pretty interesting and adds a
flair of suspense and mystery to the game. I think it’s made better by
the mysterious enemies you’re fighting and the hospital-esque visuals.
You fight Red Guys while trapped in strange grey rooms – it’s a bit
strange, really.</p>
<p>After you complete the base game, you gain access to certain features
unavailable otherwise – new gamemodes being among them. I’ll definitely
give these a try.</p>
<p>A key point in why I enjoyed this game is thanks to its running well
on my laptop. Though my laptop is decently specced, it still struggles
to reach 60 fps on multiple games in my inventory. With SUPERHOT, I had
no such issues. It always ran at a clean 60 fps, without any major
drops. It was quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>Overall, I would highly recommend it to any gamer – casual or
hardcore. It gets a 10/10 from me.</p>
