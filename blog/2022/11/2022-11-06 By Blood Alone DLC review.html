review</h1>
<p>I believe that now is the time when the weather’s going to actually
start becoming cold, which is exciting as the heat has been quite
unbearable for this time of year.</p>
<p>Enough of that, though, as today I’m going to talk a bit about the
not-so-new-anymore DLC for HOI4 By Blood Alone.</p>
<p>I’ll admit, at the start I was nothing but enthusiastic for BBA. The
plane designer felt much needed, as did the reworks of Italy and the
addition of content for Ethiopia and Switzerland. However, at this
point, I’ve begun to notice some flaws in many of the core features.</p>
<p>For example, the Balance of Power mechanic only applies to Italy,
Switzerland, and Ethiopia. Though I can understand that adding it to all
nations would be an incredible amount of excess work that wouldn’t bring
much benefit, I will note that they were once touting BoP as this great
new feature (if I’m not mistaken in my interpretation of it.) It’s quite
a bit of fun, too, so it’s quite sad that it’s not been implemented
fully.</p>
<p>The Air Designer is quite flawed in my opinion, too. For example,
increased weight does not affect speed — only agility. This is pretty
unrealistic. The limited amount of modules also gets on my nerves, too.
This is a problem with all the designers, actually. I would rather
receive a penalty for having too much shit on my tank/ship/plane than
not be able to add my stabilizer, auto-loader, sloped armor, armor
skirts, and my heavy machine gun on the same chassis.</p>
<p>I also feel that the reworked African states could have been expanded
upon. Sure, there are more states in Kenya and whatever other former
colonies they added more states too, but there’s still no Lesotho and
Eswatini. Damn it, I want to play Lesotho but they won’t let me. Dirty
bastards…</p>
<p>I honestly hope that in the next DLC they’ll refine these things.
It’s here that I’ll divert into countries that really need new/reworked
focus trees, in my opinion: - Brazil - China - Persia - Japan -
Argentina - All the Dominions - Hungary - Albania - Austria - the Nordic
States</p>
<p>These are all nations that I feel could really use some additional
content, as playing them now is quite stale. A rework of the Generic
focus tree would be quite well-appreciated, especially for me, who likes
to release random African nations and play them with full
seriousness.</p>
<p>That’s my 2 cents.</p>
