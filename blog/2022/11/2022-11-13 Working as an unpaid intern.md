2022-11-13: Working as an unpaid intern
========================
Today I worked with my dad as an unpaid intern to help him do some stuff with his colleagues at a field test of a product that I shall not name. There were many factors that made this quite an agonizing experience, namely:

- The biting cold temperatures outside
- My lack of gloves
- Wind
- A lack of water

I had to walk for quite some distance too. As the field test was being done at a field near one of the high schools in my city, I had to traverse long distances to do what was asked of me. I also ended up jogging a few laps around the track & field circuit in an effort to warm myself up, which was largely futile save for giving me a bit more steps for the day. (which I was sorely lacking thanks to my staying inside for the whole day otherwise.)

It ended up being eased through the actual nice atmosphere of the whole thing, as my dad’s coworkers were pretty chill. We ended up playing darts with the orange flag-markers that we were using for a purpose that I shall not name. I actually got a bit of laughs out of it. ‘Twas a fun time.

I ended up actually doing quite a bit, mainly using things from a regular person’s perspective. I was able to break the app that they were testing alongside the product no less than 4 times. An impressive feat, if you ask me.

I think I might do something on keyboards or breakcore. Who knows?
