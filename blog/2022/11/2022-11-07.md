========================
I did quite a lot of work for IRP, with regards to my personal logbook. I think that I was able to get about 2 months’ work of missing work done in a matter of hours with my new strategy of listening to music from HOI4 to get my brain working fully.

I added quite a lot of forged dates and other such unadmirable things — while I would rather not do such things, it was necessary to get full credit for having getting all the things done in a timely manner and consistently. I found that this also caused me to write more than I would have otherwise — because I had to fill in reasonable dates for all the occurences, and that they couldn’t be too far apart, I had to add more content that I would initially have hoped. This may have done me well in the long run, and I didn’t even know it. Damn.

Anyway, I believe that I am on track to finish IRP fully and get a good grade despite having procrastinating and doing virtually nothing for the better part of two months.
