<p>I did quite a lot of work for IRP, with regards to my personal
logbook. I think that I was able to get about 2 months’ work of missing
work done in a matter of hours with my new strategy of listening to
music from HOI4 to get my brain working fully.</p>
<p>I added quite a lot of forged dates and other such unadmirable things
— while I would rather not do such things, it was necessary to get full
credit for having getting all the things done in a timely manner and
consistently. I found that this also caused me to write more than I
would have otherwise — because I had to fill in reasonable dates for all
the occurences, and that they couldn’t be too far apart, I had to add
more content that I would initially have hoped. This may have done me
well in the long run, and I didn’t even know it. Damn.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe that I am on track to finish IRP fully and get a
good grade despite having procrastinating and doing virtually nothing
for the better part of two months.</p>
