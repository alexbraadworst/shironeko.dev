<h1 id="working-as-an-unpaid-intern">2022-11-13: Working as an unpaid
intern</h1>
<p>Today I worked with my dad as an unpaid intern to help him do some
stuff with his colleagues at a field test of a product that I shall not
name. There were many factors that made this quite an agonizing
experience, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biting cold temperatures outside</li>
<li>My lack of gloves</li>
<li>Wind</li>
<li>A lack of water</li>
</ul>
<p>I had to walk for quite some distance too. As the field test was
being done at a field near one of the high schools in my city, I had to
traverse long distances to do what was asked of me. I also ended up
jogging a few laps around the track &amp; field circuit in an effort to
warm myself up, which was largely futile save for giving me a bit more
steps for the day. (which I was sorely lacking thanks to my staying
inside for the whole day otherwise.)</p>
<p>It ended up being eased through the actual nice atmosphere of the
whole thing, as my dad’s coworkers were pretty chill. We ended up
playing darts with the orange flag-markers that we were using for a
purpose that I shall not name. I actually got a bit of laughs out of it.
’Twas a fun time.</p>
<p>I ended up actually doing quite a bit, mainly using things from a
regular person’s perspective. I was able to break the app that they were
testing alongside the product no less than 4 times. An impressive feat,
if you ask me.</p>
<p>I think I might do something on keyboards or breakcore. Who
knows?</p>
