========================
Missed my school-schedule orientation today – I’ll be going on the 5th, a mere 5 days before the school year starts. Not much else to say – today was pretty uneventful. The only thing of note was that I spent about 15 minutes trying to explain how cheating (academic) was bad to my younger sister.

Not much else to say, really.
