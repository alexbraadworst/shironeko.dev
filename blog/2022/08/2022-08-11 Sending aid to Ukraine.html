<h1 id="sending-aid-to-ukraine">2022-08-11: Sending aid to Ukraine</h1>
<p>Got chewed out by Mom for not writing today – I probably deserved it.
Here’s another debate-rewrite. (important to note that this was written
in 2020, before that whole invasion thing.)</p>
<h3 id="sending-aid-to-ukraine-1">Sending Aid to Ukraine</h3>
<p>On November 21, 2013, riots broke out in Ukraine. Violence escalated,
and Ukraine was soon set alight by a full-blown insurgency. And more
than 8 years later, that flame is still burning. If we want to
extinguish this flame, pass this legislation.</p>
<p>The first reason to pass is that it will turn the tide of the war in
favor of the Ukrainian government. The Ukrainian military may be the 3rd
largest in Europe, but it is grossly undersupplied – most of their
weapons are leftovers from the Soviet era. Because of the lack of good
equipment, Kyiv has had to back better-equipped paramilitary groups like
Pravy Sector. Many of these organizations are unreliable, and many hold
extremist views. Passing this legislation would change this. With modern
weapons and equipment as described in section 1, the Ukrainian military
would be able to fight effectively. This reduces the number of lives
lost, shortens the war, and gives Kyiv time to focus on other issues,
like repairing their economy.</p>
<p>The second reason to pass is the increased relations with Ukraine.
The US and NATO have very few allies in this part of the world. Backing
Ukraine will, in all likelihood, bring it into our sphere of influence,
as happened with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and many other states. Ukraine
would be a great forward base in the region. As ACLJ put it, “This would
also be an incredibly strategic partner to the US and NATO.” If war
breaks out on the European continent once again, a closer and stronger
Ukraine would be another ally to protect the free world.</p>
<p>For a stronger, more stable Europe tomorrow, pass this legislation
today.</p>
