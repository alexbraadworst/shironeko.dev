resolution to impose sanctions on Ethiopia</h1>
<p>Starting back up on Debate Camp rewrites – not much to say apart from
that.</p>
<h3 id="a-resolution-to-impose-sanctions-on-ethiopia-1">A Resolution to
Impose Sanctions on Ethiopia</h3>
<p>On November 19, 2020, the Ethiopian military orchestrated a mass
killing of refugees at Hitsats. Though the killing was preventable with
proper intervention, we did very little to stop it. We have a
responsibility to uphold justice and ensure the freedom of the world.
Let’s pass this legislation.</p>
<p>The first reason to pass this legislation is that Ethiopia is
actively participating in genocide against the Tigrayan minority.
According to Amnesty International, more than 700 Tigrayans were killed
in Mai Kadra from November 9-10, 2020. If we claim to be the “shining
beacon of liberty across the world,” then we should act on this claim
and take action. This inaction is not only hypocritical – it serves as a
bad precedent for the rest of the world. It’s a sign that has been
posted on our backs – commit genocide, and the USA will turn a blind
eye. This opens the door to a host of atrocities.</p>
<p>The second reason to pass this legislation is that it will stabilize
the area. The Tigrayan War has caused issues for other nations in the
region. According to Reuters on June 13, 2021, Ethiopian aircraft made
an incursion into Sudanese airspace. This was noted by the Sudanese
Foreign Ministry as a “dangerous and unjust escalation.” Ethiopian
military activity in neighboring nations could destabilize them, as seen
in Iraq as a result of the Syrian Civil War. We have an obligation to
prevent these situations, as decision-makers for the world’s leading
democracy.</p>
<p>We must protect the citizens of this Earth, no matter where they may
be. To do this, we must start by passing this legislation.</p>
