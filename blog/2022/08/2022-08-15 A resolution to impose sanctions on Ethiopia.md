2022-08-15: A resolution to impose sanctions on Ethiopia
========================
Starting back up on Debate Camp rewrites – not much to say apart from that.

### A Resolution to Impose Sanctions on Ethiopia

On November 19, 2020, the Ethiopian military orchestrated a mass killing of refugees at Hitsats. Though the killing was preventable with proper intervention, we did very little to stop it. We have a responsibility to uphold justice and ensure the freedom of the world. Let’s pass this legislation.

The first reason to pass this legislation is that Ethiopia is actively participating in genocide against the Tigrayan minority. According to Amnesty International, more than 700 Tigrayans were killed in Mai Kadra from November 9-10, 2020. If we claim to be the “shining beacon of liberty across the world,” then we should act on this claim and take action. This inaction is not only hypocritical – it serves as a bad precedent for the rest of the world. It’s a sign that has been posted on our backs – commit genocide, and the USA will turn a blind eye. This opens the door to a host of atrocities.

The second reason to pass this legislation is that it will stabilize the area. The Tigrayan War has caused issues for other nations in the region. According to Reuters on June 13, 2021, Ethiopian aircraft made an incursion into Sudanese airspace. This was noted by the Sudanese Foreign Ministry as a “dangerous and unjust escalation.” Ethiopian military activity in neighboring nations could destabilize them, as seen in Iraq as a result of the Syrian Civil War. We have an obligation to prevent these situations, as decision-makers for the world’s leading democracy.

We must protect the citizens of this Earth, no matter where they may be. To do this, we must start by passing this legislation.
