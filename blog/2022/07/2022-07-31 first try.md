2022-07-31: first try
========================

Quite anticlimactic setting up a WordPress site – it took me a few clicks to birth a brand-new, shiny website. Anyway, very few people will ever read what I have to say on this humble domain, (pun intended) so I won’t be putting much thought into formatting this thing.

The main thing I’m surprised/confused about writing this entry is the lack of Tab-indent – pressing tab doesn’t indent the text, as is the case with most websites and apps that allow string input. It’s not unmanageable – pressing the space-bar a few times works the same way, but still quite strange. There’s probably a way to properly indent, but I’m not going to spend 10 minutes on WikiHow trying to figure this one out.

Anyway, this entire site depends on how much time I decide to afford it every day, and with my work ethic (is that the right phrase to use?) it will either be the first of many hundreds of entries, or the first and last one on a barren, dead blog. I think I’ll set some sort of alarm to remind me to update this site, but I could just choose to ignore it, invalidating the whole purpose of it.

And yes, the title is an homage to geriatric1927.
