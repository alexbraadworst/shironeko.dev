<h1 id="where-in-the-us-has-the-best-geography">2022-10-19: Where in the
US has the best geography?</h1>
<p>Prompt: If you could pick any area of the country to live in because
of the geography, where would it be and why?</p>
<p>If I were limited to areas in the United States, I would either
choose to live in Cascadia or New England. Here is my reasoning.
Cascadia and New England are both areas located next to major oceans—the
Pacific and Atlantic—and suffer similar environmental consequences. Both
areas receive comparably large amounts of rain compared to the rest of
the country, which allows for the sunny days to be reasonably balanced
with rain to break up the climate structure. They also lie on comparably
high latitudes compared to the area of Texas that I live in—this allows
for cooler winters and summers, which is much better than as it is here.
Because the two areas also are located next to the ocean, it also allows
for greater moderation of the climate. Local plants and animals also
play an important role in my decision—both areas have strong fishing
industries, which is a major boost in my books, as it lowers the price
of shellfish and fish.</p>
