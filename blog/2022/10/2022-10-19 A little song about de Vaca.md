2022-10-19: A little song about de Vaca
========================


Cabeza de Vaca sailed across the sea,
From royal Spain to Florida he came.
But little food de Vaca could see
With much effort and pain, saws and axes their wood became.

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

With their tools they set to work
To build their boats to sail back home
But setting sail they wrecked their handiwork
So with the Indians they made their zone

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

The surviving ones of de Vaca’s troop
Made friends among the Karankawa group
The friends traded food and other valuable loot
With the survivors of de Vaca’s sloops.

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

After months upon months of struggle and strife
Many a man had lost their life
Clothes and food were without supply
The friends of before had agreed to ply
The men with many of their needs

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

The shamans and priests of the Karankawa tribe
Demanded the men bless the men who died
de Vaca’s men had little choice
But to follow the orders of the men of the tribe

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

For many a year de Vaca would continue
To trade and bless with the Karankawa people
With his retinue, Castillo and Estevanico
They made their way across the land

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But oh, it was not meant to be.

Finally after years among them
de Vaca had an opportunity to leave with his men
Upon eating a dog, they were filled with vitality
So finally their voyage reached its finality.

de Vaca sailed across the sea,
For King and Country they set out to be
The explorers of the land of the teepee
But now they found themselves before the bourgeoisie
That so long ago they had left by decree
So after years away from their native marquis
Their hearts, oh they were filled with glee.
