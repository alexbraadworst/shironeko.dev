2022-10-07: On Scienteer
========================
Recently I had the oppportunity to finish up my Scienteer information for my IRP project. Here is my honest opinion on the software, from a student point of view.

The sentiment of transitioning away from paper is a respectable one, and a view that I find to be the best for both the environment and students themselves. However, Scienteer does not seem to be a good implementation of the digital technologies available to services like it. I find that there is very little room for any customization by any metric – there is no dark mode, no personalization for the UI.

I understand that, being an educational software built for use by students and teachers, it does not necessarily need such commodities. However, I believe that there was ample opportunity for them to implement such things in the obvious years it’s been since they updated the thing. I am genuinely concerned with the level of maintanence that the site is maintaining, as, from what I’ve seen, neither the UI or any other visible aspect of the site has changed in several years. In this it has now become dated in appearance, with its UI befitting a site from 2014. I think this still is acceptable, but it could be better.

Sorry for the rant, and for the lack of a consistent upload timeframe.
