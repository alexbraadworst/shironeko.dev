2022-10-19: Where in the US has the best geography?
========================
Prompt: If you could pick any area of the country to live in because of the geography, where would it be and why?
	
If I were limited to areas in the United States, I would either choose to live in Cascadia or New England. Here is my reasoning. Cascadia and New England are both areas located next to major oceans—the Pacific and Atlantic—and suffer similar environmental consequences. Both areas receive comparably large amounts of rain compared to the rest of the country, which allows for the sunny days to be reasonably balanced with rain to break up the climate structure. They also lie on comparably high latitudes compared to the area of Texas that I live in—this allows for cooler winters and summers, which is much better than as it is here. Because the two areas also are located next to the ocean, it also allows for greater moderation of the climate. Local plants and animals also play an important role in my decision—both areas have strong fishing industries, which is a major boost in my books, as it lowers the price of shellfish and fish.
