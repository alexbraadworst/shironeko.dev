2022-10-12: Ravenfield review
========================
I recently bought the game Ravenfield, and I must say that it’s pretty good. It is exactly the kind of game that I’ve been looking for for years — its simple visuals run well on my Intel Iris Xe Max GPU, which usually barely chugs along when rendering most games. The simple controls made it relatively easy to learn and to get decent at. I also praise the extensive efforts of the modding community in an effort to make the game a more realistic and fun experience. There are many different mods to choose from in this regard – from historical weapons to maps based off of realistic scenarios, and in some cases, actual historical locations.

I think it will be a staple of my Steam library for many years to come – that is, if it doesn’t get some game-breaking update that completely bricks it.
