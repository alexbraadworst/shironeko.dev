<h1 id="a-little-song-about-de-vaca">2022-10-19: A little song about de
Vaca</h1>
<p>Cabeza de Vaca sailed across the sea, From royal Spain to Florida he
came. But little food de Vaca could see With much effort and pain, saws
and axes their wood became.</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>With their tools they set to work To build their boats to sail back
home But setting sail they wrecked their handiwork So with the Indians
they made their zone</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>The surviving ones of de Vaca’s troop Made friends among the
Karankawa group The friends traded food and other valuable loot With the
survivors of de Vaca’s sloops.</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>After months upon months of struggle and strife Many a man had lost
their life Clothes and food were without supply The friends of before
had agreed to ply The men with many of their needs</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>The shamans and priests of the Karankawa tribe Demanded the men bless
the men who died de Vaca’s men had little choice But to follow the
orders of the men of the tribe</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>For many a year de Vaca would continue To trade and bless with the
Karankawa people With his retinue, Castillo and Estevanico They made
their way across the land</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But oh, it was not meant to
be.</p>
<p>Finally after years among them de Vaca had an opportunity to leave
with his men Upon eating a dog, they were filled with vitality So
finally their voyage reached its finality.</p>
<p>de Vaca sailed across the sea, For King and Country they set out to
be The explorers of the land of the teepee But now they found themselves
before the bourgeoisie That so long ago they had left by decree So after
years away from their native marquis Their hearts, oh they were filled
with glee.</p>
