<p>Well, it’s Christmas Eve, and we’re about to take off on vacation
soon enough, so I felt obligated to make an extra long entry.</p>
<p>Most of what I thought necessary to implement in the setup has been
added and accounted for — I have a nice keyboard and mouse, and an
ergonomic chair. The only things that I can really add would be
vehemently denied by my parents for being unnecessary, so all I can do
at this point is to refine it and make it the most aesthetically
pleasing that it can possibly be. I have already sorted out the issues
with cables on the bottom of the desk, so all I can really do is change
up what the desk is like on the surface. I think that my main issue lies
in my USB-C dock, from gaming to how clean my setup looks. Though it
offers exceptional connectivity and does remove several cables from my
desk, its own cable is non-detachable and incredibly short — this
necessitates it to be put on top of my desk, rather than under which is
where I would’ve liked it to be. My monitor stand also takes up a large
amount of space. The only real way to rectify these is to buy a better
USB-C dock and a VESA monitor arm, as doing any other things would
either increase the number of necessitated cables or significantly
impact my ergonomics and the functionality of my setup.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
