========================
Well, it’s Christmas Eve, and we’re about to take off on vacation soon enough, so I felt obligated to make an extra long entry.

Most of what I thought necessary to implement in the setup has been added and accounted for — I have a nice keyboard and mouse, and an ergonomic chair. The only things that I can really add would be vehemently denied by my parents for being unnecessary, so all I can do at this point is to refine it and make it the most aesthetically pleasing that it can possibly be. I have already sorted out the issues with cables on the bottom of the desk, so all I can really do is change up what the desk is like on the surface. I think that my main issue lies in my USB-C dock, from gaming to how clean my setup looks. Though it offers exceptional connectivity and does remove several cables from my desk, its own cable is non-detachable and incredibly short — this necessitates it to be put on top of my desk, rather than under which is where I would’ve liked it to be. My monitor stand also takes up a large amount of space. The only real way to rectify these is to buy a better USB-C dock and a VESA monitor arm, as doing any other things would either increase the number of necessitated cables or significantly impact my ergonomics and the functionality of my setup.

Oh well.
