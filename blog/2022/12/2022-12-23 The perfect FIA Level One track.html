Level One track</h1>
<p>Haven’t exactly been the most consistent with updates as of late, but
I feel that now is the opportunity to reflect on something that’s been
bugging me for a while.</p>
<p>That thing is — what would the perfect Level One racing
circuit/complex look like? What would it feature?</p>
<p>Many people (including myself) often bash Tilke as a bad track
designer, who made a few decent tracks. The main reason he receives such
criticism is because his designs are repetitive and seem to have more
attention given towards facilities rather than the actual racing going
on out on track.</p>
<p>However, many of his most common design elements are pretty alright —
I’m sure most people who watch F1 or any similar series (Super Formula,
F2, F3, et cetera) love esses and high-speed corners. I do too, as
they’re fun to watch. However, it should not be overdone, nor should it
be precise. The entire reason why COTA and Silverstone have such great
sections of esses is because the approach to each turn is slightly
different to the one previous to it. It should not be lifeless.</p>
<p>Elevation change is one of the best factors going into a circuit, and
it can make or break a circuit depending on how it’s executed. Elevation
changes at Spa and other tracks have given us Eau Rouge, Casino Square,
and COTA Turn 1. I’m pretty sure a large number of the issues that
people have with Abu Dhabi today could be remedied (not fixed, mind you,
as this is Abu Dhabi we’re talking about here) if there was more
elevation change.</p>
<p>Of course facilities and safety are important, and a certain level of
care needs to be put into them, of course. I may be alone in saying that
the stripes now found on Paul Ricard actually look nicer than gravel.
Considering that road surface offers a much more controllable experience
for drivers, this concrete runoff could be implemented quite readily.
However, some drivers may be knocked unconscious by, say, flying debris
(à la Felipe Massa) and thus unable to apply the brakes or steer out of
a collision — what happens then? Gravel as a runoff isn’t completely
replaceable — of course, any non-oval track that wants even the
slightest chance of being approved for the F1 calendar needs some. It
provides resistance to cars without requiring any action on the part of
the driver. However, it should be toned down from its current usage.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are a few of the ideas that can go into tracks for
better, safer racing.</p>
