<p>Well, WordPress decided to hand me a prompt right before I started
writing, so I’ll answer the following question:</p>
<p><em>What is your opinion on eating meat?</em></p>
<p>Well, I think that meat is perfectly fine if one consumes it within
reason. Of course there is a climate argument to be made here, but I
think most of the arguments on cruelty (specifically, the ones on how
killing animals is morally unjustifiable, NOT the totally valid argument
on the injustice of factory farming) are completely bogus.</p>
<p>Factory farming is of great concern, and it’s something worth looking
into stopping. The conditions endured by animals in these kinds of
facilities, are, to be fair, quite appalling, and it should be prevented
the same as other cruel practices towards animals.</p>
<p>The climate argument is, to me, the most reasonable, as it is
something that has a tangible effect on the lives of humans. According
to the American Institute of Economic Research, meat <a
href="https://www.aier.org/article/the-climate-impact-of-meat/">does
have a significant effect on the climate</a>. It is therefore quite
reasonable to curb meat consumption in order to help slow global
warming, which is one of the major issues that the world is faced with
currently.</p>
<p>However, I still believe in the consumption of meat for two main
reasons: one, that it is enjoyable and a good way to connect with
others, and two, that it provides a livelihood to millions of people
around the world. I think these two reasons are pretty valid, but it can
be subject to interpretation.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m writing this as someone who both enjoys meat and
doesn’t know the full picture, so there’s that.</p>
