2022-12-03: On meat-eating
========================
Well, WordPress decided to hand me a prompt right before I started writing, so I’ll answer the following question:

*What is your opinion on eating meat?*

Well, I think that meat is perfectly fine if one consumes it within reason. Of course there is a climate argument to be made here, but I think most of the arguments on cruelty (specifically, the ones on how killing animals is morally unjustifiable, NOT the totally valid argument on the injustice of factory farming) are completely bogus.

Factory farming is of great concern, and it’s something worth looking into stopping. The conditions endured by animals in these kinds of facilities, are, to be fair, quite appalling, and it should be prevented the same as other cruel practices towards animals.

The climate argument is, to me, the most reasonable, as it is something that has a tangible effect on the lives of humans. According to the American Institute of Economic Research, meat [does have a significant effect on the climate](https://www.aier.org/article/the-climate-impact-of-meat/). It is therefore quite reasonable to curb meat consumption in order to help slow global warming, which is one of the major issues that the world is faced with currently.

However, I still believe in the consumption of meat for two main reasons: one, that it is enjoyable and a good way to connect with others, and two, that it provides a livelihood to millions of people around the world. I think these two reasons are pretty valid, but it can be subject to interpretation.

Of course, I’m writing this as someone who both enjoys meat and doesn’t know the full picture, so there’s that.
