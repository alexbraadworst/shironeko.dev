<h3 id="section">1</h3>
<p>In the late night, workers at a lumber mill near Smolensk shared
stories, drank, and celebrated their newfound freedom. Constructed
during the German occupation, the lumber mill was typically a quiet,
cold place until the first Russian troops swept through the building
during the war. One of the first things that changed was the flag, and
now the bright, cheery colors of the Federation adorned the pole that
sat outside. Now the workers weren’t afraid to not only look at the flag
they lived under, but also at the stars that hung above them.</p>
<p>Under the summer sun of Belgorod, a group of young students took
their stipend out to a freshly built commercial district. They wanted to
flair up their clothing and maybe even buy some makeup. Only after all
the laughter and celebration did they realize they had spent too much,
and several the next day had to make a call home. Despite having to call
home, none had to worry if they would see their families again.</p>
<p>Within Moscow’s first reconstructed synagogue, a sight no one inside
would have believed only a year ago would ever happen again, a public
Bar Mitzvah was being held. Not only did the fear of their entire
culture being eradicated leave their mind for that moment, but they
could be happy about the future for the first time. Among the tears and
laughter that followed, they danced deep into the night, knowing this
was but the first of many nights.</p>
<p>Throughout the massive motherland, the people celebrated, danced, and
sang songs many thought were lost. In a place typically thought of as a
cold and unforgiving place, the people of the Federation found warmth in
the passion they now had in freedom.</p>
<p><em>The torch of liberty has thawed the Motherland.</em></p>

<p>Ivan Kuratov was once a scarred man. The long hours of backbreaking
labor, the beyond brutal conditions, and the icey cold in the Vorkuta
labor camp did that to everyone, prisoner or guard, who was foolish
enough to inhabit it. To this day, he carried the scars, and the
hardened palms of those days. He once thought that life under that
continuous cycle of petty fiefdoms would never end. Even after the NKVD
fell,he’d just come under another government who cared not for his well
being. But now, times were changing.</p>
<p>When Kuratov had migrated to the city of Barnaul, and saw President
Shukshin for the first time, his heart had beat with something that he
had not experienced since childhood. Jubilation. Hope. A genuine dash of
idealism. An infectious dream of eternal optimism, and true unbridled
happiness for the future. The sun seemed to shine brighter on his face,
now plastered with a dumb wide grin.</p>
<p>Now that the wars were over, the reforms were done, and his life
truly transformed, he thought that he’d seen the end of wonder. He was
wrong. That morning, he’d woken up to a stunning announcement.
Elections. President Shukshin had given way to democracy, and was
scheduling elections. Now his life was flooded with banners, posters,
slogans, political campaigns, and the debates and news on his newly
bought television set. He’d truly seen another Russian miracle. One
greater than the miracle on the Volga, or on the Don. One greater than
the miracle of the 2nd West Russian War.</p>
<p>On his way back home, he was intercepted by the Novaya Gazeta for a
poll. With a wide smile, and groceries in hand, he said confidently:</p>
<p>“President Shukshin has my vote.”</p>

<p>Boris Solovyev had always hated moving. From the times of the German
invasion and having to flee the family home, to the forced deportations
by the labor camps, he hated moving. To him before, moving had always
brought anguish, uncertainty, and sadness for the future. But now that
was changing, just like everything else in Russia.</p>
<p>As he tugged his suitcase along the pavement of Rostov, a backpack on
his shoulders, he felt as if a long night had passed and morning was
coming. Oh, Rostov’s redevelopment was progressing nicely – the new
commercial developments, new and modern residential areas, and all sorts
of new leisure activities were certainly nothing to scoff at. But he was
headed somewhere else – to Volgograd, the southern gem of Russia’s new
crown. He could almost see the high-tech offices, and Alexander Nevsky’s
bronze frame (at last, the city was restored to its former glory!) as he
entered the Rostov Central Rail Station.</p>
<p>He made it through security without a hitch, and was soon at the main
hall of the station. He swiped his card on the automated kiosk, and 20
rubles and about 30 seconds later he found himself with one ticket to
Volgograd aboard Russia’s newest spectacle, the Skorostnoypoyezd, their
new high speed rail network. Already thousands of kilometers of new
tracks were being laid, and Russia’s recovering cities seemed to be
brought closer together. Seeing as he’d arrived early, he thought he’d
go and grab something to eat while he waited the roughly 30 minutes for
the train to arrive at the station.</p>
<p>Soon he found himself at the station’s Teremok, which was packed with
commuters, movers, and vacationers alike, all waiting on the same quick
bite. Teremok was a rising name in Russia’s restaurant scene, combining
Western conveniences such as fast service and low prices with a
traditional Russian palette. He stood in line for a minute or two before
it was time for him to order. He decided to get a plate of blini with
some mors, and before long he was sitting down to eat his food.</p>
<p>While he chowed down and watched the clock, he began to swipe through
the newest issue of the Novaya Gazeta. Apparently, the first general
elections had been held in the recently freed Ukraine, and the results
were overwhelmingly in favor of the liberal Civic Position party, with a
dominating 185 of the 320 seats of the Verkhovna Rada and the
presidency, with the newly elected Petro Tymoshenko to be inaugurated
within about 4 months. He was delighted; he thought it great that the
other peoples of Eastern Europe could share in their newfound
freedom.</p>
<p>Putting away his plate and once again lugging his suitcase, he went
back to the terminal just in time to nab a decent seat with a good view.
He pushed his suitcase into the overhead shelf and his backpack under
the seat in front. Upon sitting down, he noticed that the seats were not
only quite comfortable but also could recline – he wasted no time in
making use of it. As he settled in for the roughly 2 hour journey, he
had but one thought on his mind.</p>
<p><em>What a great time it is to be a Russian.</em></p>
<h3 id="section-3">4</h3>
<p>Boris Solovyev had settled in nicely in Volgograd over the past few
months. He managed to score a nice one-bedroom apartment in a brand new
development, with his 14th-story room offering a commanding view of the
new business district of the city. Modern furnishings, a comfortable bed
to sleep in, heating and air conditioning, a television… if you had told
him 10 years ago where he’d be living today, he wouldn’t have believed
you in the slightest. Hell, he’d even started dating a girl. At 34, he
wasn’t late to the show yet, and he’d met a lovely girl named Valentina
at the bar about 3 months ago. They’d met each other’s parents and
everything.</p>
<p>Which brought him to the question; where to for their first vacation
together? He had managed to score a few weeks off work, and the same
could be said for her as well. The first destination on the list had
been Moscow, of course; nothing could match the Third Rome in beauty and
prowess, even after decades of rot and mistreatment by the Germans.
St. Petersburg was also on the table, but seeing as it was still being
rebuilt it wasn’t on it for long. However, Valentina was no ordinary
woman, and she certainly didn’t want any ordinary vacation.</p>
<p>“Kazakhstan? I mean, if you want to go I wouldn’t be opposed…”
Valentina’s face lit up.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s so much to do there! Just imagine us, riding off into
the steppe on a majestic stallion, while we drink horse milk…”</p>
<p>Boris struggled to swallow a gag that popped up upon hearing
<em>that</em>, but for her he was more than willing to endure the horror
that it invoked in him. So now, after a week or so of preparation and
packing, they were now in the newly built Pyotr Anokhin International
Airport, which had just begun offering nonstop service to Alma-Ata via
Russia’s new flag carrier, Air Russia. After passing through the
security checkpoint without incident, and after Valentina successfully
negotiated the acquisition of matching neck pillows, they found
themselves aboard a new Yak-42 trijet airliner, flown by a Great
Patriotic War veteran crew and served by well-trained flight attendants.
Everything was laid out for the flight to be great, but still Boris
found himself a bit anxious – he’d never been in a plane before, so that
was to be expected as much.<br />
All of that melted away once he saw the buildings of Volgograd fade away
into clouds, giving way to the brilliant Russian sky, now free of
foreign oppression and terror. Joy overtook him as he stared out into
the seemingly endless sea of blue before him, and he looked back at
Valentina.</p>
<p>“Signs of what’s to come, eh?”</p>
